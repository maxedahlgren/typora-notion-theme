# Notion for Typora

A faithful reproduction of the original Notion theme, available in both dark mode and light mode.

## Styles

The theme is available in two styles: `original` and `enhanced`. The original style features simpler quotations and tables, mimicking the Notion app. The enhanced style darkens quotation backgrounds and adds alternating colors to the table backgrounds, improving visibility.

Additionally, in the original style, code fences more closely resemble those in Notion, having bright red text and a gray background. Inline code is more muted in the enhanced version.

## Install

- Download the latest [zipped themes package](https://github.com/adrian-fuertes/typora-notion-theme/releases).
- Copy the chosen `.css` file(s) to your Typora theme library (you can open the folder in ` preferences > appearance > themes`).
- Launch or restart Typora and choose the theme from the menu.

> Note: This theme has been created and tested in macOS 12, though it should work on Windows too.
>
> Having `SF Mono` or `Fira Code` installed is highly recommended for appropriate code display.
